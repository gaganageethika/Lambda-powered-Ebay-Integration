```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaganageethika/Lambda-powered-eBay-Integration.git
cd Lambda-powered-eBay-Integration
```
### 2. Update Environment Variables
Set your `EBAY_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the AWS Lambda environment settings.

### 3. Test Locally (Optional)
You can test the Lambda handler locally with tools like `AWS SAM` or `pytest`.

### 4. Deploy to AWS Lambda
Zip your project and deploy it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
